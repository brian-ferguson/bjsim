 1. Add histogram or density plot of final bankrolls over 10,000 runs
What it means:
Instead of running just one simulation, you run the same simulation 10,000 times, each time simulating the full 37,500 hands. You then track how much money you have at the end of each simulation.

Why it helps:
It shows the distribution of outcomes, which gives a visual of how volatile the strategy is. You'll see whether most outcomes are clustered around your expected value or if the results are very spread out (high variance).

How to implement:

Run your Monte Carlo simulation loop 10,000 times.

For each run, record the final bankroll.

Plot the distribution:

In Python: use matplotlib or seaborn to create a histogram (plt.hist(final_bankrolls)).

In Excel: collect results in a column and insert a histogram chart.

✅ 2. Show standard deviation and 95% confidence interval of profits
What it means:
Standard deviation (σ) measures how spread out the outcomes are. A 95% confidence interval shows the range where your final profit will land 95% of the time, assuming the results are normally distributed.

Why it helps:
This gives a realistic range of outcomes. It answers: “If I played this strategy 100 different times, where would most of my results land?”

How to implement:

After simulating 10,000 runs and collecting the final profit each time:

Compute the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the 10,000 profits.

Then compute the 95% confidence interval:
CI = [μ - 1.96·σ, μ + 1.96·σ]

This tells you: “I can expect to end up with a profit between $X and $Y in 95% of cases.”

✅ 3. Include RoR for different bankrolls (e.g., 50%, 75%, 100%)
What it means:
Risk of Ruin (RoR) depends heavily on starting bankroll. If the recommended bankroll is $9,124 and you only have half that ($4,562), your RoR will be much higher.

Why it helps:
Instead of reporting only the RoR at your current bankroll, you can give a table like this:

Bankroll Size	Risk of Ruin
50% of recommended	70%
75%	45%
100%	32%
125%	22%

How to implement:

Rerun the simulation for different initial bankrolls.

For each one, record the percentage of simulations that ended in ruin (i.e., bankroll reaches $0).

You can define "ruin" as hitting 0 or falling below a stopping point like $500.

✅ 4. Calculate N₀ (number of hands to be 1 SD above breakeven)
What it means:
N₀ is a blackjack concept that estimates how many hands you must play to have an expected profit equal to one standard deviation of your variance.

Why it helps:
It tells you how long you need to play for skill (EV) to outweigh luck (variance).

How to calculate:
You need two pieces of info:

EV per hand (from your simulation)

Variance per hand

Then:

𝑁
0
=
variance per hand
(
EV per hand
)
2
N 
0
​
 = 
(EV per hand) 
2
 
variance per hand
​
 
Example:

EV per hand = $0.036

Variance per hand = $9.00 (let’s say standard deviation is $3 per hand)

𝑁
0
=
9.00
(
0.036
)
2
≈
6
,
944
 hands
N 
0
​
 = 
(0.036) 
2
 
9.00
​
 ≈6,944 hands
This means: after ~7,000 hands, your edge is expected to be greater than standard deviation — i.e., more likely to profit than not.
